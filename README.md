## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I love creating xml layouts so much, but, as a professional, I need to be open for new,
so I decided to take this challenge and get new experience in my favourite field of
creating User Interface. I also had an experience with Flutter and even wrote my
graduation work about it, so I was even more interested in trying native declarative UI
and see the difference between this realizations.
